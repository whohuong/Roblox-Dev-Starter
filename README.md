My love for computer programming blossomed during my high school years of game development on the popular, online game platform known as Roblox. Much of what I learned is thanks to the generous, open-sourced developers who shared their work with young, aspiring developers like me.
As a way to give back to the community, I am creating this repository with the purpose of having all of its contents be open and free-to-use by all. Much of the contents are aimed towards beginner developers who are in need of simple, beginner-friendly code to learn from. The projects included in this repository are:
1. A number randomizer.
2. A basic GUI with simple functions.
3. A saving currency system.
4. An administrator program.
5. A custom chat box display.
6. etc.
